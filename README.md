## MIFSA ##
**MIFSA** is a python script made by students of the OAN (National Astronomic Observatory) from Colombia. The program makes an integral field spectra analysis of the datacubes from [CALIFA](http://www.caha.es/CALIFA/public_html/?q=node/1) (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey), by showing the astronomic image and spectra associated to each pixel of it.

The goal of the project is to calculate some important spectra values like FWHM and flux of some important reference lines.
